                        With the advent of technology in the medical industry, telesurgery has emerged as a transformative era of conventional medical practices to facilitate remote and efficient surgical procedures for the betterment of patients' health. Moreover, innovative technologies introduce a full-immersive metaverse environment for enabling communication between patients and doctors virtually and efficiently. Nevertheless, remote telesurgery operations in the metaverse are susceptible to various security and privacy issues that need to be tackled to secure the patient's confidential health data. Thus, we design an Ethereum blockchain-based decentralized application (DApp) for selecting and conducting telesurgery operations based on the doctors' specialization and type of surgery.

                        The growth of electric vehicles (EVs) at a significant pace is a promising solution for reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional vehicles. Nevertheless, optimal and efficient EV charging management is a serious concern that needs to be solved for the benefit of both charging stations (CSs) and EVs. In this regard, we proposed a smart contract and Interplanetary File System (IPFS)-based secure EV synchronization framework at the CS utilizing a 5G wireless network. Blockchain technology strengthens the security of the EV charging at the CS in a synchronized and coordinated manner. The IPFS and 5G wireless network ensure efficient and reliable EVs synchronization to charge vehicles from the available number of charging points (CPs) at a CS. Furthermore, we have coordinated and synchronized the EV charging, considering various scenarios based on the waiting queue time, energy demand, and EVs (they can arrive in an emergency). We have shown the implementation interface of the proposed model based on the execution of a smart contract using the Remix Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Moreover, we have performed the security analysis of the smart contract using Echidna fuzzing-based tool to ensure the secure EVs allocation to the corresponding CS. Finally, the performance analysis of the IPFS and smart-based proposed model is evaluated and simulated considering various metrics such as transaction storage cost analysis, computational and communication overhead analysis, utilized cost based on the smart contract functions, and the number of EVs.

                        The penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) in the energy market has become an immersive paradigm for facilitating a greener environment by mitigating the disadvantages of fossil-fuel vehicles. Nevertheless, it becomes critical for charging stations (CSs) to handle a huge number of EVs, further leading to uncoordinated and inefficient charging. Moreover, none of the authors have considered the possible EV charging scenarios for allocation at the CS. Thus, we have designed an Ethereum blockchain-based decentralized application for EV charging at the CS along with the energy trading between prosumer and consumer EVs. Further, we have formulated charging scenarios based on the energy demand and type of EV (emergency and high priority). We have deployed the smart contract in the Remix Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and further built a decentralized application using Web3 to make charging allocation accessible to the EVs. Finally, the simulation results of the proposed smart contract for the application are evaluated in terms of gas consumption and cost analysis with the help of the deployed smart contract in the Remix IDE.

                        Purpose: With the advancement and modernization of Information and Communication Technology, electronic voting (e-voting) has been adopted across the globe for conducting a secure and efficient voting procedure. However, e-voting can be easily exposed to various malicious attacks such as denial-of-service, malware, insider, compromised credentials, etc., that can risk the voter’s privacy and affect the final voting results. Thus, we have considered the decentralized and immutable blockchain technology for completing the voting procedure securely. Nevertheless, many researchers have considered blockchain to mitigate the security and privacy issues of the voting procedure, but they ignored the aspect of cost-efficiency, latency, and response time while voting. Method: The idea of the proposed mechanism is to deploy and implement the smart contract in the Remix Integrated Development Environment (IDE) involving number of voters electing the candidate with various functionalities. Moreover, we considered the amalgamation of blockchain and IPFS to overcome the data storage cost issues of blockchain for voters and candidates communicating through 5G wireless network. The 5G network, with its low latency, high availability, and high reliability facilitates high data rate and reliable communication between voters and candidates to complete the voting procedure efficiently. Results: The deployed smart contract of the proposed voting mechanism highlight various functionalities required for electing the candidate by the voters. Moreover, the deployed smart contract is evaluated and analyzed considering various performance metrics such as gas consumption analysis for smart contract functions and number of voters, cost analysis for smart contract functions, bit error rate, and storage cost comparison with the traditional scheme. We have also verified the security of the proposed voting mechanism using Echidna security tool which shows the election of candidate without any threat. Conclusion: Finally, we have presented a blockchain-based voting mechanism in which IPFS and 5G is employed to avail the cost-efficient, reliable, and secure candidate election by the voters. Moreover, the voters and candidates can communicate with lower response time and high reliability using 5G network so that smart contract consisting of all the functionalities related to the candidate election can be executed efficiently in the Remix IDE.

                        The extensive deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) globally has become an alternative to fossil-fuel or gasoline vehicles to tackle harmful greenhouse gas emissions. But, huge EV charging demand can bring challenges to the charging infrastructure by destabilizing the grid stability and affecting efficient EV charging. Thus, the aforementioned challenges can be addressed by facilitating energy trading (ET) between EVs which can act as prosumers or consumers. We have proposed a blockchain-based secure ET scheme for EV coordination using the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) protocol to mitigate the data storage cost issues of the blockchain. Opportunistically, we have considered various ET scenarios to coordinate the communication between prosumer and consumer based on waiting time and priority levels. Moreover, the data communication between EVs is considered via a 5G network for highly reliable and efficient ET. Finally, the proposed scheme is evaluated by executing the smart contract in the Remix Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with various performance metrics such as gas consumption and cost analysis. Additionally, a security analysis using the Echidna tool shows that the smart contract runs without vulnerability.

                        Recently, a paradigm shift is observed toward Industry 5.0, where tasks (processes) are automated at massive scales. This shift has initiated modern developments in artificial intelligence (AI) to support a plethora of applications like manufacturing, health care, vehicular networks, and others. However, owing to the black-box nature of AI models, the research has shifted toward the proposal of novel techniques that aim toward the explainability and validity of these AI models. Thus, explainable AI (XAI) has become a norm in modern applicative domains, and the study of its frameworks and tools has become the buzzword among researchers. Thus, the paper intends to present the key concepts of XAI and aims at improving the model transparency. The survey systematically untangles the key concepts of XAI and presents a solution taxonomy in different applications. Modern XAI techniques are classified as self-explanatory, visual-based-model-agnostic, global surrogate, and local surrogate-model-agnostic. We also cover the tools and frameworks of XAI and discuss the open issues and challenges in practical realization. Thus, the survey intends to arm AI practitioners to design optimal solutions to realize XAI in practical use-case setups.

                        This paper proposes a novel framework for automatically directing the user to an appropriate helpline number in an emergency based on his/her emotional state. For emotion detection, we integrate four benchmark datasets (SAVEE, RAVDESS, TESS, and Crema-D). We further examine the impact of various features on this comprehensive dataset and see the possibility of generalization with the help of diversified data. The highest accuracy achieved by the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is 93.14% using the proposed approach. The results indicate that our emotion recognition model highly depends on the choice of audio features. Finally, we use this prediction to build our single-emergency number helpline architecture which predicts the caller’s emotions and directly connects them to the desired person for seeking mental help through counselors, protection with the help of police, or a general call center for any other help. This framework reduces the response time and provides a single point of connection.

                        The advent of telemedicine with its remote surgical procedures has effectively transformed the working of healthcare professionals. The evolution of telemedicine facilitates the remote monitoring of patients that lead to the advent of telesurgery systems, i.e. one of the most critical applications in telemedicine systems. Apart from gaining popularity, the telesurgery system may encounter security and trust issues of patients’ data while communicating with the surgeon for their remote treatment. Motivated by this, we have presented a comprehensive survey on secure telesurgery systems comprising healthcare, surgical robots, traditional telesurgery systems, and the role of artificial intelligence to deal with the numerous security attacks associated with the patients' health data. Furthermore, we propose a blockchain and federated learning-based secure telesurgery system to secure the communication between patient and surgeon. The results of the proposed system are better than those of the traditional system in terms of improved latency, low data storage cost, and enhanced data offloading. Finally, we explore the research challenges and issues associated with the telesurgery system.

                        There is a massive transformation in the traditional healthcare system from the specialist-centric approach to the patient-centric approach by adopting modern and intelligent healthcare solutions to build a smart healthcare system. It permits patients to directly share their medical data with the specialist for remote diagnosis without any human intervention. Furthermore, the remote monitoring of patients utilizing wearable sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, and artificial intelligence (AI) has made the treatment readily accessible and affordable. However, the advancement also brings several security and privacy concerns that poorly maneuvered the effective performance of the smart healthcare system. An attacker can exploit the IoT infrastructure, perform an adversarial attack on AI models, and proliferate resource starvation attacks in smart healthcare system. To overcome the aforementioned issues, in this survey, we extensively reviewed and created a comprehensive taxonomy of various smart healthcare technologies such as wearable devices, digital healthcare, and body area networks (BANs), along with their security aspects and solutions for the smart healthcare system. Moreover, we propose an AI-based architecture with the 6G network interface to secure the data exchange between patients and medical practitioners. We have examined our proposed architecture with the case study based on the COVID-19 pandemic by adopting unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for data exchange. The performance of the proposed architecture is evaluated using various machine learning (ML) classification algorithms such as random forest (RF), naive Bayes (NB), logistic regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and perceptron. The RF classification algorithm outperforms the conventional algorithms in terms of accuracy, i.e., 98%. Finally, we present open issues and research challenges associated with smart healthcare technologies.
